This is a data set of four companies and their stock values from the previous 100 days.  The csv data contained includes the opening value, the highest value of the date, the lowest value of the date, the closing value of the stock, and the volume of the stock.  The four companies selected were: Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and Netflix.  The data is pulled from the alpha vantage API, which is free for the data pulled but there are some premium functions if you are looking for more advanced values.
